    <h2>Welcome to my Portfolio</h2>
    <h4>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I am a recent graduate of Northeastern University with a BS in Data Science.I have experience working on data and machine learning projects, mainly using Python. I also have experience working directly with customers in my past work experiences.

My main interests are in the AI and ML fields. I hope to work on challenging projects in this industry moving forward. Gaining powerful advantages and insights through data is important for every business in the modern world, no matter what industry it is in.

I can help an existing company utilize data analysis and AI to achieve their goals. Also, I am interested in working with new AI start-up companies. I am minoring in entrepreneurship so I would love to work with a motivated team to make an impact in the data field. In addition to working on the technical aspect of things I would enjoy working on the business side of the company. I have experience communicating with both technical and non-technical customers, clients, and stakeholders.

            seminars, and fundraisers. I also managed the team’s website, social media, and frequent correspondence with vendors and clients.This was my first experience working professionally in my field, and it couldn’t have been a more
            enjoyable and valuable experience. </p>
